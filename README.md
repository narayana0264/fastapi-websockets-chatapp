# Overview
This chat application demonstrates how to implement a WebSocket server using FastAPI. It allows clients to connect via WebSockets, send messages, and receive real-time broadcasts from other clients. Each client is assigned a unique ID, and the chat messages are displayed with that ID to distinguish between different users. The frontend is built using HTML and styled with Bootstrap for a clean interface.

# Features
Real-Time Communication: Clients can send and receive messages instantly.
Broadcasting: Messages are sent to all connected clients, creating a group chat experience.
Client Management: Each client is uniquely identified by an ID.
WebSocket Support: Uses WebSockets for efficient, real-time communication.
Bootstrap Frontend: A responsive UI built with Bootstrap for ease of use and modern design.
Graceful Disconnects: Properly handles WebSocket disconnections and informs other users when a client leaves the chat.

#Tech Stack
FastAPI: A modern web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
WebSockets: Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and the server.
HTML5 & JavaScript: Used for the frontend to interact with the WebSocket server.
Bootstrap 5: A front-end framework for building responsive, mobile-first websites.


# Installation
To run this application locally, follow these steps:
**Clone the repository:**
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fastapi-websocket-chat.git
cd fastapi-websocket-chat
**Create a virtual environment**
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
**Install the dependencies:**
pip install fastapi[all]
**Run the application:**
uvicorn main:app --reload


# Code Explanation
1. FastAPI Server Setup
The application starts by creating a FastAPI instance (app = FastAPI()), which handles both HTTP requests and WebSocket connections.


2. HTML Frontend
The / route serves an HTML page that acts as the frontend for the chat application. This page uses WebSocket for communication with the FastAPI backend and Bootstrap for styling.


Key components of the frontend:
Input field for typing messages.
List to display messages from the chat.
JavaScript for managing WebSocket connections and sending/receiving messages.


3. Connection Manager
The ConnectionManager class handles active WebSocket connections. It maintains a list of all connected clients and provides methods to send messages to specific clients or broadcast them to all clients.
connect(): Adds a WebSocket connection to the list.
disconnect(): Removes a WebSocket connection when a client disconnects.
broadcast(): Sends a message to all connected clients.


4. WebSocket Endpoint
The /ws/{client_id} WebSocket endpoint handles WebSocket communication. Each client is assigned a unique ID (generated by Date.now() in the frontend). Clients can send messages to the server, and the server broadcasts those messages to all connected clients.
